# retaining wall plan generation software.  The following values
# should be set:
#   DesignParamsFile - a file containing the values of many design parameters
#   PlansTextFile - a file containing static text to be included in the
#      generated plan document
#   OutputLatexFile - where to write the generated output
#
# See the DesignParamsFile and PlansTextFile under the "sample-design"
# directory (included in this distribution) for explanations of the contents
# of those files.

DesignParamsFile = "DesignParams-AllanBlock"
